    <h1>The Challenge</h1>
    <p>
      <u>This year's ProgFest will be different from prior years.</u> It
      consists of data structure and algorithm exercises within Android
      applications. The first part of the day will be a 2 hour hands-on workshop
      on creating very basic Android applications. The rest of the day will
      involve creating Android games that require the use of relatively
      sophisticated algorithms and data structures.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        All exercises will be done in Java (with a small amount of XML) - a good
        grasp of Java is required.
      </li>

      <li>
        Knowledge of at least these Java data structures is needed: HashMaps,
        ArrayLists, Sets, Trees, Tries.
      </li>

      <li>
        Knowledge of recursion would be helpful, along with algorithms such as
        breadth-first search and search.
      </li>

      <li>Knowledge of basic text Java IO would also be helpful.</li>

      <li>
        Practice using Android Studio and deploying Android apps to an emulator
        will make doing the projects easier.
      </li>
    </ul>
